1. minmax algorithm:
number of nodes expanded:
Depth level:2 -
    nodes expanded = 143888 on 3rd move
Depth level:1 -
    nodes expanded = 560 on 2nd move
time and space complexity: 
O(n^d)

2. alphabeta pruning:
number of nodes expanded:
Depth level:2 - 
    nodes expanded = 6880 on 3rd move
Depth level:3 - 
    nodes expanded = 261979 on 2nd move
time and space complexity: 
 O(n^d/2)
